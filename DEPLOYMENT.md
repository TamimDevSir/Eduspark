# 🚀 GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

## Quick Setup for GitHub Pages

### 1. Repository Setup
1. Create a new repository on GitHub (or use existing one)
2. Push your code to the repository:
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Gamified Education Platform"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
git push -u origin main
```

### 2. Enable GitHub Pages
1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click **Settings** → **Pages**
3. Under "Source", select **GitHub Actions**
4. The deployment workflow will run automatically

### 3. Build Configuration
The platform includes a GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) that:
- ✅ Automatically builds the application
- ✅ Optimizes for production
- ✅ Deploys to GitHub Pages
- ✅ Handles offline-first functionality

### 4. Repository Name Configuration
The deployment workflow automatically uses your repository name for the base URL. 

**No manual configuration needed!** The workflow will:
- ✅ Set the correct base path: `/${{ github.event.repository.name }}/`
- ✅ Handle SPA routing with 404.html fallback
- ✅ Optimize for offline-first functionality

**Important Notes:**
- Ensure your repository name doesn't contain special characters
- The platform is designed to work offline, so no backend server is needed
- All data is stored locally using IndexedDB for rural connectivity

### 5. Access Your Live App
After deployment completes (5-10 minutes), your app will be available at:
```
https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/YOUR_REPO_NAME/
```
