Design & implement a Gamified Education Platform for rural schools, grades 6–12.
The platform must be fully functional, multilingual (English / Hindi / Odia), and offline-first.
Navigation must always allow: Back | Home | Logout/Exit | Language Toggle.

🔐 Authentication & Access

Login Page inspired by GitHub.

Portals: Student | Teacher | Developer.

Login options: Email+Password, Google OAuth.

Features: “Forgot Password” → reset flow; “Sign Up” → validation + confirmation.

Offline Access (students only): bypass login, load cached lessons.

Enter button must be animated.

🎓 Student Portal
1. Grade Selection

After login → Student chooses Grade (6–12).

Redirects to that grade’s Subjects Dashboard.

2. Subjects Dashboard (per grade)

Subjects vary by grade:

Grade 6–8: Math, Science, Social Science, English, Local Language.

Grade 9–10: Math, Science, Social Science, English, Odia/Hindi.

Grade 11–12: Math, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Social Studies, English.

Each subject expands → Units → Chapters → Lessons.

Lesson page has:

📖 Lesson Content (text, diagrams, explanations).

🎮 “Learn this as a Game” button.

3. Gamified Learning

Grade 9 Games (fully functional prototype):

(a) Science – Motion Simulation Game

Interactive object reacts to Newton’s Laws.

Right side: theory explanation; left side: experiment area.

Student drags/pushes object to test laws.

Scoring: XP for correct action, retry hints for mistakes.

(b) Mathematics – Algebra Puzzle Game

Grid puzzle with equations.

Correct answers unlock next blocks.

Completing puzzle reveals hidden word.

XP + Achievements awarded.

Other grades (6–8, 10–12):
Game button opens message:
“⚠️ Game not yet available for this grade. Please continue with the lesson.”

4. Progress Tracker

Circular progress charts by subject.

Drill down: subject → units → lessons → completion % + last accessed.

Resume from last checkpoint.

5. Leaderboard

Shows Top 10 students by XP in class.

Student’s own rank highlighted.

Clicking a student → show their XP + progress breakdown.

🧑‍🏫 Teacher Portal
Dashboard Features

Syncs with cloud when online.

Conflict resolution: latest timestamp wins.

🏗️ Deliverables (from AI)

Frontend (React/Tailwind):

LoginPage

GradeSelectionPage

SubjectDashboard

LessonPage (with “Play as Game”)

MotionGame (Grade 9 Science)

AlgebraPuzzleGame (Grade 9 Math)

ProgressTracker + Leaderboard

TeacherDashboard + MailBox

Backend (Node/Express + Firebase/Postgres):

Auth API (/login, /register, /googleAuth)

Syllabus API (/syllabus/:grade)

Progress API (/progress/:studentId)

Reports API (/reports/:teacherId)

Leaderboard API (/leaderboard/:grade)

Sync API for offline → online merges

⚡ Final Instruction to AI:
Generate production-ready modular React frontend + Node/Express backend.
Each click (lesson, game, progress, mail, leaderboard) must perform a real action.
Grade 9 has fully working Science + Math games; all other grades must still work for lessons and navigation.
Teacher Mail Box must support sending/receiving messages from NGOs/Corporates about scholarships.
Every screen must have back, home, exit, and language toggle.
